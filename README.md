# ML_Project20-PneumoniaClassification

### Pneumonia Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
This project explores using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection. The model is trained on a dataset containing normal and pneumonia chest X-ray images.

### Data Acquisition
The code defines paths to the training, validation, and test directories within the downloaded chest X-ray dataset.

### Preprocessing
Images are loaded using Pillow (PIL) and converted to NumPy arrays.

The ImageDataGenerator class from TensorFlow is used for data augmentation techniques:

Rescaling image pixel values to the range [0, 1].

Converting images to grayscale.

Random horizontal flips for data augmentation.

Training and validation DataGenerators are created using flow_from_directory which automatically applies transformations and generates batches.

### Model Architecture
A CNN architecture is defined using the Keras functional API:

1)Convolutional layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
2)Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
3)Flatten layer to convert the extracted features into a 1D vector.
4)Dense layers with ReLU activation for classification.
5)Sigmoid activation in the output layer for binary classification (normal vs. pneumonia).


### Model Training
The model is compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.

The model is trained for a specified number of epochs using the fit function with training and validation data.

### Evaluation
The evaluate function calculates the loss and accuracy on the test dataset to assess the model's generalization performance.

### Further Exploration
Experiment with different CNN architectures like VGG16 or ResNet.

Try transfer learning with pre-trained models on a large image dataset like ImageNet.

Visualize the learned filters to understand what features the model focuses on.

Explore data augmentation techniques like random rotations and zooms.

### Additional Considerations
This is a basic example of pneumonia classification. In a real-world medical setting, this model should not be used for diagnosis purposes. It is crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any medical concerns.
